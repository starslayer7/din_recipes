<h1>Margherita pizza is known for its ingredients representing the colours of the Italian flag. These ingredients include red tomato sauce, white mozzarella and fresh green basil.</h1>
 <p1>The city of Naples in Italy is widely known to be the home of pizza. Napels was founded as early as the 16th-century. The majority of the population was very poor and so pizza , flatbread with toppings that was sold by street vendors and could be eaten for any meal â€“ met the needs of Neapolitans as a food that could be eaten quickly and was cheap</p>
 <p2>These early iterations of pizza were usually topped with a variety of things, such as tomatoes, cheese, olives, anchovies, and garlic. The famous French writer, Alexandre Dumas, even described the wide array and diversity of pizza toppings in 1843.</p2>
