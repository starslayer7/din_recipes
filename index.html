<h1>Pizza Margherita</h1>
<img src="https://assets.biggreenegg.eu/app/uploads/2018/06/28115815/topimage-pizza-special17-800x500.jpg">
<h2>Margherita pizza is known for its ingredients representing the colours of the Italian flag. These ingredients include red tomato sauce, white mozzarella and fresh green basil.</h2>
 <p>The city of Naples in Italy is widely known to be the home of pizza. Napels was founded as early as the 16th-century. The majority of the population was very poor and so pizza , flatbread with toppings that was sold by street vendors and could be eaten for any meal , met the needs of Neapolitans as a food that could be eaten quickly and was cheap</p>
 <p>These early iterations of pizza were usually topped with a variety of things, such as tomatoes, cheese, olives, anchovies, and garlic. The famous French writer, Alexandre Dumas, even described the wide array and diversity of pizza toppings in 1843.</p> 
<h3>INGRIDIENTS</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>Pizza Dough</li>
     <li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
     <li>Fresh Mozzarela</li>
     <li>Fresh Basil</li>
     <li>Olive Oil</li>
     <li>Salt</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
     <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
     <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
     <li>Roll out the dough: if you ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets</li>
     <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.

 <h1>Calzone</h1>
  <img src="https://ricetta.it/Uploads/Imgs/calzone.jpg">
<h2>A calzone is actually a type of pizza, but the big difference is it's inside out! The dough is on the outside and the “toppings” are inside the calzone making it a completely different experience from eating a pizza.</h2>
  <p>The fillings are placed on one half of the circular shaped pizza dough. The dough is then folded over, pinched and sealed, coated with an egg wash or olive oil, and baked in the oven until golden brown.

</p>
<p>If you love calzones, you have probably tried its close cousin, stromboli. Stromboli vs Calzone – what sets them apart? Although both have similar ingredients, the way they are sealed is different. Calzones are pinched and sealed like empanadas and are handheld, while a stromboli is rolled up and sliced.</p>
<h3>INGRIDIENTS</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
      <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup yellow onion diced</li>
      <li>1 cup green bell pepper diced</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese shredded</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 425 F and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
       <li>Divide pizza dough into 4 equal parts and roll each dough ball into a 1/4 inch thick circle.</li>
       <li>On half of each dough circle, add equal parts sauce, yellow onion, green bell pepper, and sliced pepperoni. Make sure to leave a little room around the edges so you can crimp the calzone shut.</li>
       <li>Sprinkle the toppings with equal parts shredded cheese. Then fold the other half of the dough over the toppings and crimp the edges.</li>
       <li>Cut 2-3 air vents into the top of the calzone and place it on to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
       <li>Brush with olive oil and bake for about 15 minutes or until the dough is fully cooked and the calzone is golden brown.</li>
       <li>Serve with warmed pizza sauce for dipping.</li>

<h1>Prosciuto E Funghi</h1>

 <h2>The traditional combination of ham and crimini mushrooms creates a very filling pizza with a rich and strong flavor.</h2>  
  <p>Prosciutto e funghi is a pizza variety that is topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, thin slices of prosciutto cotto, and mushrooms. Some varieties can be topped with olives or served drizzled with olive oil.</p1>
<p>A simple but delicious ham and mushroom pizza recipe, perfect for girls nights in or making with the kids at the weekend. You can adapt the toppings to your own taste.</p>
<h3>INGRIGIENTS</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>pizza dough</li>
     <li>mozzarella</li>
     <li>crimini mushrooms</li>
     <li>ham</li>
     <li>tomato sauce</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>The first thing you need to do is turn on your oven and preheat it to 220˚C/ 430˚F. While waiting for the oven to heat, prepare your ingredients. Start with slicing the ham.</li>
    <li>Chop the mushrooms into thin round slices.</li>
    <li>Put the tomatoes into a pan and pour some boiling water on them. Hold the tomatoes in the water for a few seconds and then remove the skins</li>
    <li>Chop the tomatoes and mash them with a fork to release the juice.</li>
    <li>Now let s roll out our pizza. You may stretch the pizza dough with your knuckles like all professionals do, but it s always easier to use a rolling pin. Sprinkle the table with flour, dip the dough in the flour as well and roll it into a thin sheet.</li>
    <li> Put the crust on an oiled pizza screen. Don t worry if the crust loses its shape while you handle it — just shape it into a circle again and don t worry about the small folds that you might get.</li>
    <li>It s time to put our pizza in the oven! Keep it in the oven for about 15-20 minutes — it can take more or less than that depending on how quickly your oven bakes.</li>
